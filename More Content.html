        <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
        <p>
          Body mass index (BMI) is a tool that healthcare providers use to
          estimate how much body fat you have by measuring your height and
          weight. It can be useful in assessing risk factors for certain health
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most people, BMI is correlated with body fat (the higher the
          number, the more fat you may have), but in some cases it is not very
          accurate. BMI alone does not determine health.

        <h2>What is BMI used for?</h2>
        <p>
          Health care providers use BMI and other tools and tests to assess
          health status and safety risks in people. Too much body fat can lead
          to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Too little body fat can
          be linked to malnutrition. This index helps determine the right amount
          of body fat relative to vitamins and minerals. It also determines how
          much energy your body uses, helps maintain body temperature, and
          protects your organs from obesity.
